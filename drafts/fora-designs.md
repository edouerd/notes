Hi Martians —

I’d like to present some works I’ve been noodling on for the last two weeks or so, as an assist of sorts to some simple-app use cases `~tonret-sigsur` and `~dorlun_sibnus` have been working on. 

Here is a link to some static-designs representing Feed, Link, Mesh, and a sampling of other small interfaces:

The link should be viewable without an account, but if you’d like to see my annotations and/or leave some of your own, you’ll need to make a [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) account (it’s a great free solution to interface designing in the browser).

Additionally, I’ve attempted to translate the above into some basic prototypes here:

As a bonus, here is a file parsing through the initial run of interfaces displayed in during the 2017 star sale, and seeing how they'd work on mobile devices:

Along with the application/use-cases explored above, I’ve been considering other useful applications that’d get me (a decidedly not-as-technical-as-most-of-you urbit user) using Urbit for simple and frequent tasks. Ideally, these simple apps would warm people up to the idea of performing light computation or tasks on our baby computer-network.

Utilities

Slides
Refer to https://slides.com for an ideal web-based slide-building app. Feature set could be pared down to the point of text insertion/placement, code block placement, image placement, and a simple grid.

Event Scheduler
A simple hour-by-hour scheduler — allows two or more ships to agree on an interval of time to meet. Refer to https://beta.doodle.com  or https://www.when2meet.com

Notes
Simple markdown note taking. (Technically this is possible with .md files and clay+tree, but a dedicated interface for writing, styling, and searching for notes would be nice)

Media

eBook reader
Simple reader that sources books from a nested directory (maybe import calibre libraries/metadata?).
Could use a modified https://github.com/futurepress/epub.js as a front end maybe.

Reading Bookmarklet/Annotation Storage
A service like this could go hand-in-hand with an eBook app, in the sense that both ‘pages read online’ and ‘books’ could be collated into a ship-based library/knowledge store.
