> I think that the Internet is going to be extremely important. Information about collections and designers’ philosophies will become accessible across the world, independently of the physical location of stores or showrooms. A designer label’s website will have the same role as a catalog at an exhibition — not a replacement for the actual confrontation with the garments, but an introduction or reminder. However, information on the Internet has to be presented properly. Not in the current playful mode like a computer game, but seriously as a new classic means of information.
